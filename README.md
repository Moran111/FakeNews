This dataset contains text and metadata from 244 websites and represents 12,999 posts in total from the past 30 days. The data was pulled using the webhose.io API; because it's coming from their crawler, not all websites identified by the BS Detector are present in this dataset. Each website was labeled according to the BS Detector as documented here. Data sources that were missing a label were simply assigned a label of "bs". There are (ostensibly) no genuine, reliable, or trustworthy news sources represented in this dataset (so far), so don't trust anything you read.
